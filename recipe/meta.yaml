  summary: RBC - Remote Backend Compiler
  description: |
    The aim of the Remote Backend Compiler project is to distribute
    the tasks of a program JIT compilation process to separate
    computer systems using the client-server model. The frontend of
    the compiler runs on the client computer and the backend runs on
    the server computer. The compiler frontend will send the program
    code to compiler backend in LLVM IR form where it will be compiled
    to machine code.
